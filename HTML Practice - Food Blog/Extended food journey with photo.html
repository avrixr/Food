    <h1> Food Journey </h1>
    <hr>
    <p> My name is Avrix. That little picture down there is me. Happy as can absolutely be You're probably
      wondering why I'm making this. Well, I want to express how important food has been through the journey of my life.

    <p> The journey began back in Kindergarten. Some of the earliest food memories I have are: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> My mom's fried Chicken straight out of the pot </li>
      <li> My mom's smothered pork chops (Or as I used to call it, "Chicken")</li>
      <li> Bakers </li>
      <li> Mom's steaks (Or as I used to call it, "Chicken")</li>
    </ul>

        <p> I've had a lot of food experiences in my life. Some of them were good, some of them were bad. But I've learned a
      lot from them. The first upscale experience I had was at a restaurant called "Duane's" at the Riverside Mission
      Inn.
      I believe it was for my 9th birthday, and I had one of the best Filet Mignons I have ever had. Granted, since that
      was my first reference for expensive meat cuts, there was no bar to beat. In my adult experience, Duane's holds a
      special place in my heart, but it's nothing to get your hopes up for.</p>

      <p> The first Michelin rated restaurant I ate at was at <a href="https://www.citrinandmelisse.com/">Citrin and
        Melisse</a>, a French-New American spot in Santa Monica, California. To this day, I dream of the egg dish my mom
      and I each had when we visited called "La Egg" It was a beautiful dish of poached eggs with a creamy sauce topped
      with caviar and served with a flakey crostini. (Picutred below)</p>
